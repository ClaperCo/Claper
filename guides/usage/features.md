After your presentation, you can export all the submissions in CSV format.

When you create a new presentation, click on **Present/Customize**, select the slide where you want to add embed and click **Add interaction**.

You can choose to show the embed in the attendee side, so your audience can see the embed content during your presentation.

## Moderation tools

You can moderate the messages during your presentation. You can delete messages or ban users from the dashboard. 

Banning the user will prevent him to send messages during the presentation and is based on a token that is stored in the browser. If the user clear his cookies, he will be able to send messages again.
