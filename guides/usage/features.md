# Features

The main goal of Claper is to provide a simple and easy to use integrate feedback during your presentations.

We don't want to add a lot of features but instead focusing on the core features that are needed to provide a good feedback experience.

## Forms

You can also add forms during your presentation. Users can fill the form and you can see all submissions in real time.

When you create a new presentation, click on **Present/Customize**, select the slide where you want to add form and click **Add interaction**.

After your presentation, you can export all the submissions in CSV format.

## Moderation tools

You can moderate the messages during your presentation. You can delete messages or ban users from the dashboard. 

Banning the user will prevent him to send messages during the presentation and is based on a token that is stored in the browser. If the user clear his cookies, he will be able to send messages again.
