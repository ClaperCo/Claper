Claper turns your presentations into an interactive, engaging and exciting experience.

Claper has a two-sided mission:
- The first one is to help these people presenting an idea or a message by giving them the opportunity to make their presentation unique and to have real-time feedback from their audience.
- The second one is to help each participant to take their place, to be an actor in the presentation, in the meeting and to feel important and useful.
