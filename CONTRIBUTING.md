## Translations

You can contribute to the translations by editing the files in `/priv/gettext/`
Each language has its own directory with the `.po` files. The country code is used as the directory name and following the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) nomenclature, for example, `en` for English, `fr` for French, `de` for German. You can find the list of country codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).

### Add new language

To add a new language, you can copy the `en` directory and rename it with the country code of the new language. Then you can edit the `.po` files with the translations.
