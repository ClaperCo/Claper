Claper turns your presentations into an interactive, engaging and exciting experience.

Claper has a two-sided mission:
- The first one is to help these people presenting an idea or a message by giving them the opportunity to make their presentation unique and to have real-time feedback from their audience.
- The second one is to help each participant to take their place, to be an actor in the presentation, in the meeting and to feel important and useful.

Supported languages: ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German.

### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

To run Claper on your local environment you need to have:
* Postgres >= 9
* Elixir >= 1.13.2
* Erlang >= 24
* NPM >= 6.14.17
* NodeJS >= 14.19.2
* Ghostscript >= 9.5.0 (for PDF support)
* Libreoffice >= 6.4 (for PPT/PPTX support)

You can also use Docker to easily run a Postgres instance:
```sh
  docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=claper -e POSTGRES_USER=claper -e POSTGRES_DB=claper --name claper-db -d postgres:9
  ```

### Configuration

You can find all configuration options in [the docs](https://docs.claper.co/configuration.html).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ClaperCo/Claper.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   mix deps.get
   ```
3. Migrate your database
   ```sh
   mix ecto.migrate
   ```
4. Install JS dependencies
   ```sh
   cd assets && npm i
   ```
5. Allow execution of startup file
   ```sh
   chmod +x ./start.sh
   ```
6. Start Phoenix endpoint with
   ```sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

If you have configured `MAIL` to `local`, you can access to the mailbox at [`localhost:4000/dev/mailbox`](http://localhost:4000/dev/mailbox).


### Using Docker Compose

A Docker Compose [reference file](https://github.com/ClaperCo/Claper/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) is provided in the repository. You can use it to run Claper with Docker Compose.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ClaperCo/Claper.git
cd Claper
docker compose up
```


### Using Docker Compose for Dev

To easy check new features, it is possible to directly build the Docker image from the source code and run the container with the [docker-compose-dev.yml](https://github.com/ClaperCo/Claper/blob/main/docker-compose-dev.yml) file.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ClaperCo/Claper.git
cd Claper
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```
